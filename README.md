**AI Engineering Lead @ Atlax360**

19 years building software, working with AI systems since 2015. I specialize in multi-agent architectures, RAG pipelines, and systems that actually work in production—not slide deck demos.

## What I Do

I lead AI engineering at Atlax360, where we build systems that combine LLMs with production-ready architectures. Also manage the frontend platform because someone needs to make sure what we build on the backend makes sense to the people using it.

Current stack:
- **Backend:** FastAPI, async Python, Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector), Redis
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel AI SDK
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Transformers, sentence-transformers, PyTorch
- **Document Intelligence:** Docling, pdfplumber, OCR (EasyOCR, Tesseract), full Office suite processing

I work on:
- Multi-agent systems for document analysis and automation
- RAG pipelines with semantic search and vector databases
- Heavy document processing (PDFs, Office files, OCR, structured extraction)
- Full-stack AI applications that people actually use

## Philosophy

I prefer systems that solve specific problems over architectures that sound impressive. AI is a tool, not magic—if it doesn't improve a measurable process, it's not useful.

I've seen enough AI projects die because nobody thought about maintenance or scale. I care about the boring part: making it work reliably when nobody's watching.
