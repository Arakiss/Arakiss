# Petru Arakiss  
## AI & Software Engineering Leader | Full-Stack, Cloud & AI  

I’ve spent the last 18+ years navigating the intersection of web development, cloud computing, and AI, working on everything from full-stack applications to distributed AI systems. These days, I’m particularly focused on pushing the boundaries of multi-agent architectures and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), finding ways to make autonomous systems collaborate more effectively in real-world enterprise environments.  

### 🔭 What I’m Working On  

Lately, I’ve been diving deep into:  
- Designing cognitive architectures that merge RAG with autonomous agents  
- Developing enterprise-grade multi-agent systems for security and data intelligence  
- Exploring new ways to optimize retrieval systems with hybrid search techniques  
- Building event-driven architectures that scale intelligently with demand  

### 🛠 The Tools I Use  

#### AI & Machine Learning  
- **Agent Systems**: Multi-agent architectures, cognitive frameworks, agent-based reasoning  
- **RAG & LLMs**: Hybrid retrieval, semantic search, prompt engineering  
- **MLOps**: Model fine-tuning, automated deployment pipelines, monitoring  

#### Cloud & Scalable Architectures  
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure—focused on scalable, resilient infrastructure  
- **Event Processing**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, event-driven patterns for real-time data  
- **DevOps & Automation**: Terraform, CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code  

#### Full-Stack Development  
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, modern component-based architectures  
- **Backend**: Node.js, FastAPI, building high-performance APIs  
- **APIs & Data Flow**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC—designing efficient data pipelines  

### 🌟 Some Things I’ve Built  

Over the years, I’ve worked on projects that blend AI, security, and automation. A few highlights:  
- **Enterprise AI Agents** – Scalable multi-agent systems that automate security analysis and decision-making  
- **RAG-Driven Knowledge Systems** – High-performance retrieval models that intelligently filter and process vast amounts of information  
- **Cognitive Agent Frameworks** – Architectures designed to improve coordination and reasoning among autonomous agents  
- **Real-Time Data Pipelines** – Event-driven, distributed systems that handle large-scale data processing with AI at their core  

### 💡 What I Bring to the Table  

Beyond just technical expertise, I focus on designing systems that are:  
✔️ Scalable & resilient  
✔️ Secure by design  
✔️ Architected for real-world impact  

### 📫 Let’s Talk  

I’m always up for a discussion about multi-agent systems, AI-driven automation, and how intelligent architectures are shaping the future of enterprise tech.
