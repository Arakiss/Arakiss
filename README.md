An experienced developer with more than 15 years' experience in technical development, including 10 years of managing and leading diverse engineering teams across a variety of industries. A versatile and innovative leader with a focus on full-stack web development. As a software leader, I am passionate about learning and teaching cutting-edge technologies, promoting internal growth, and leading distributed teams of software developers. Committed to continuously improving the development processes of the company to ensure its success. Expertise in navigating complex ecosystems and managing them in the most efficient way.

Whether conceptualizing or implementing a solution, I am motivated to solve real-world problems. In terms of technical expertise, I possess a wide range of skills. My career has largely involved working with JavaScript technologies (frontends, backends, infrastructure), however I have also been exposed to other programming languages and have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of computer science concepts, programming language paradigms, and principles as a result of my educational background. As a result of this knowledge, I am capable of picking up a language that I am unfamiliar with within a short period of time and becoming proficient in it.

* Lead highly productive development teams in new technology stacks that are rapidly emerging. 
* Designing and implementing performant, distributed applications with a strong focus on performance.
* Assessment of open-source frameworks and languages based on their advantages and disadvantages.
