**Head of AI Engineering & Frontend Platform @ Atlax360**

I've spent 19 years building software and the last decade focused on AI systems. These days I architect multi-agent platforms, RAG pipelines, and document intelligence systems that actually ship to production. I also run the frontend platform at Atlax360 because building good AI is pointless if nobody can use it.

## What I'm Working On

At Atlax360 I'm leading three platforms that combine LLMs with production-grade architectures:

**Bifrost** is our document intelligence and RAG infrastructure. It handles complex document processing at scale and powers semantic search across organizational knowledge. The architecture uses multi-agent orchestration where specialized agents handle different domains and coordinate through message passing.

**Orvian** is a multi-tenant platform for B2B workflow automation. We're building intelligent orchestration for business processes that require multi-channel coordination and decision support. Right now it has SSO, invitation flows, and flexible RBAC. The roadmap includes LLM-assisted workflow engines and automated communication across multiple channels.

**Polaris** is our internal knowledge assistant. It's an agentic layer on top of Bifrost that lets teams query organizational knowledge through natural conversation. Supports multiple languages and integrates with existing business systems to surface the right information when people need it.

All three run on the same stack because maintaining different architectures for similar problems is a waste of time.

## Stack

**Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Redis

**Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

**AI/ML:** OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, PyTorch, Transformers

**Databases:** PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search

**Tools:** Vercel AI SDK, Drizzle ORM, pydantic, structlog

## Open Source

I build tools when I see a gap worth filling:

**bunkit** - Modern CLI for Bun-powered projects. Scaffolds production-ready apps in seconds.

**ghostty-warp** - Brings Warp-inspired features to Ghostty terminal. Auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, fuzzy search, and themes.

**commitloom** - AI-powered commit message generation. Makes git history actually useful.

**nexlog** - Logging library for Next.js that works across server, browser, and edge without fighting you.

## Philosophy

Most AI projects fail for boring reasons. People chase the latest model instead of solving the actual problem. They build impressive demos that fall apart under load. They forget about error handling, monitoring, rate limits, and all the unglamorous stuff that makes systems reliable.

RAG is just information retrieval with extra steps. Multi-agent systems are task decomposition, not sentience. The value is in the problem you solve, not the technique you use. I prefer maintainable systems that work over architectures that sound impressive in meetings.

The hard part isn't getting a prototype to work. It's making it reliable enough that you can sleep at night.

## Background

I work 100% remote from Madrid. Before Atlax360 I built everything from game engines to financial systems. I believe the best code is the code you don't have to write, which is why I'm interested in AI that reduces complexity instead of adding layers.
