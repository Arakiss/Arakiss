# Petru Arakiss  
## AI Architect | Software & Cloud Engineer  

I design and build AI systems that go beyond automationâ€”systems that analyze, reason, and adapt. With 18+ years of experience in software engineering, cloud infrastructure, and AI, I focus on developing intelligent architectures that integrate large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent systems for enterprise applications.  

### ðŸ”­ Current Work  

Right now, Iâ€™m working on:  
- **AI system architecture** â€“ Designing modular, scalable AI infrastructures  
- **Multi-agent systems** â€“ Building autonomous agents that collaborate for data analysis and security  
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** â€“ Improving how AI retrieves and processes information  
- **Event-driven architectures** â€“ Creating scalable pipelines for AI-powered data workflows  

### ðŸ›  Tech & Tools  

#### AI & Machine Learning  
- **Autonomous Agents** â€“ Multi-agent architectures, cognitive AI models  
- **RAG & LLMs** â€“ Hybrid retrieval, semantic search, knowledge augmentation  
- **MLOps** â€“ Model deployment, monitoring, and optimization  

#### Cloud & Infrastructure  
- **Cloud Platforms** â€“ AWS, Azure, cloud-native architectures  
- **Data & Event Processing** â€“ Kafka, RabbitMQ, real-time data pipelines  
- **DevOps & Automation** â€“ Terraform, CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code  

#### Full-Stack Engineering  
- **Frontend** â€“ React, Vue.js, component-driven architectures  
- **Backend** â€“ Node.js, FastAPI, high-performance APIs
