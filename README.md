## AI Architect | Software Engineer

I design AI systems that reason, adapt, and scale. With 18+ years of experience in software engineering and intelligent systems, I focus on architectures that integrate large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent frameworks for real-world use.

### Current Focus

* **AI system architecture** – Modular, production-ready design
* **Multi-agent systems** – Autonomous, goal-driven agents
* **RAG pipelines** – Structured retrieval and semantic search
* **Event-driven workflows** – Real-time data processing

### Tools & Technologies

* **AI/ML** – LLMs, RAG, semantic search, cognitive agents
* **Infra & Automation** – Kafka, FastAPI, CI/CD, scalable APIs
* **Full-Stack** – React, Node.js, GraphQL, clean component design

### Projects

* AI agents for threat detection and autonomous data analysis
* Retrieval systems for intelligent search and decision-making
* Agent-based frameworks for distributed reasoning
* Scalable AI pipelines for real-time, event-based systems

### Interests

Building AI that solves actual problems—efficient, reliable, and aligned with business goals.
