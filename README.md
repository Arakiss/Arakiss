**AI Engineering Lead @ Atlax360**

19 years building software, working with AI systems since 2015. I specialize in multi-agent architectures, RAG pipelines, and systems that actually work in production—not slide deck demos.

## What I Do

I lead AI engineering at Atlax360, where we build systems that combine LLMs with event-driven architectures for real-world use cases. Also manage the frontend platform because someone needs to make sure what we build on the backend makes sense to the people using it.

I work mostly with:
- Multi-agent architectures for automation and analysis
- RAG pipelines with semantic search and structured retrieval
- Scalable systems using Kafka, FastAPI, and whatever makes sense for the problem
- Full-stack when needed (React, Node.js, GraphQL)

## Philosophy

I prefer systems that solve specific problems over architectures that sound impressive. AI is a tool, not magic—if it doesn't improve a measurable process, it's not useful.

I've seen enough AI projects die because nobody thought about maintenance or scale. I care about the boring part: making it work reliably when nobody's watching.
