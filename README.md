# Hi, I'm Petru Arakiss üëã

### About Me

I'm a developer with over 15 years of experience in technical development, including 10 years of managing and leading diverse engineering teams across a variety of industries. I specialize in full-stack web development and am a versatile and innovative leader. I'm passionate about learning and teaching cutting-edge technologies, promoting internal growth, and leading distributed teams of software developers. I'm committed to continuously improving the development processes of the company to ensure its success. I have expertise in navigating complex ecosystems and managing them in the most efficient way possible.

In terms of technical expertise, I possess a wide range of skills. My career has largely involved working with JavaScript technologies (frontends, backends, infrastructure), however I have also been exposed to other programming languages and have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of computer science concepts, programming language paradigms, and principles as a result of my educational background. As a result of this knowledge, I am capable of picking up a language that I am unfamiliar with within a short period of time and becoming proficient in it.

### My Specializations üöÄ

- Leading highly productive development teams in new technology stacks that are rapidly emerging.
- Designing and implementing performant, distributed applications with a strong focus on performance.
- Assessing open-source frameworks and languages based on their advantages and disadvantages.
- Supporting and encouraging the growth of the team as a whole.
- Scaling teams during times of rapid growth.
- Assisting with technical problems by providing the most effective solution possible by taking a hands-on approach.
